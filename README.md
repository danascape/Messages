## How This App Differs from QKSMS and QUIK

This project is built on original fork from QKSMS and QUIK, but it takes a different directions in several areas.

- **Opinionated UX choices:** Instead of offering a large set of themes or layouts, the app prioritizes a single, consistent visual style to keep navigation predictable and distraction-free.
- **Reduced dependency footprint:** Compared to QKSMS’s extensive use of libraries for animations and theming, this project aims to keep external dependencies to a minimum for better control and easier maintenance.
- **Selective feature set:** Rather than replicating the full feature set of QKSMS (e.g., extensive theme packs, scheduled messages) or QUIK's rapid-action gestures, this app includes only the features necessary for a streamlined workflow.

### Project Goals
- Provide a messaging experience that stays fast over time.
- Keep the codebase easy to understand and updated with latest Android trends.
- Offer a consistent UI focused on clarity rather than personalization or speed tricks.

This project is not intended as a clone or competitor to QKSMS or QUIK. Instead, it explores a different path for designing an SMS app with minimalism and maintainability at its core.
